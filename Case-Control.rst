=====================
Case-Control Analysis
=====================

OpenCRAVAT can perform basic comparisons between case and control
cohorts in a study. The Case/Control feature allows users to (1) count
samples in case and control groups with particular genotypes, (2)
compute the one-sided p-value using Fisher’s Exact Test. Case and
control sets are defined by a separate input file.

Installing
----------

Install the ``casecontrol`` module. This module may not be available in
older versions of OpenCRAVAT.

.. code:: bash

    oc module install casecontrol

Case/Control requires scipy to perform statistical tests. On most
systems, this can be installed with ``pip3 install scipy``, but consult
the `scipy website <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`__ for more
specific instructions.

Running
-------

Case-Control may be run from the command line in most OpenCRAVAT
versions, and from the GUI in versions above 2.2.0.

Both methods will require a text file which assigns samples to a cohort.
The file contains two columns, with whitespace as the delimiter.

::

    sample_0    case
    sample_1    control

Samples which are not in the cohorts file, or are assigned a cohort
other than case or control, will not be included in the analysis.

You will be notified if samples in the cohorts file cannot be found in
the job. In some cases, this is because multiple input files were used.
In that situation, the sample ID must be prefixed with the filename of
the input it came from, and a double underscore. For example, a sample
called ``sample_0`` from file ``input.vcf`` would become
``input.vcf__sample_0``. ### Command line

Run casecontrol in the command line by pointing the module to the
cohorts file.

.. code:: bash

    oc run input --module-option casecontrol.cohorts=cohorts.txt

GUI
~~~

Run casecontrol in the GUI by scrolling to the bottom of the left hand
panel in the submit page, to the section called "Additional Analysis".
Then, click the "Case-Control cohorts" button to select your cohorts
file.

Interpreting results
--------------------

There will be nine output columns. The three columns shown by default
are p-values of the likelihood that a variant occurs more in case
samples under three different inheritance models. Six hidden columns
include counts of homozygous, heterozygous and reference variants across
the cohorts.

P-value calculation for inheritance modes
-----------------------------------------

For the Dominant model, we create a 2x2 contingency table to assign a
p-value using a Fisher's exact test. The first column includes the
number of samples that have any alternate allele, whether heterozygous
or homozygous.

+------------+-------------------+-------------+
|            | Alt (Aa and aa)   | Ref (A/A)   |
+============+===================+=============+
| Cases      | N11               | N12         |
+------------+-------------------+-------------+
| Controls   | N21               | N22         |
+------------+-------------------+-------------+

For the Recessive model, we create a 2x2 contingency table to assign a
p-value using a Fisher's exact test. The first column includes the
number of samples that are homozygous for the alternate allele.

+------------+------------+-------------------+
|            | Alt (aa)   | Ref (AA and aa)   |
+============+============+===================+
| Cases      | N11        | N12               |
+------------+------------+-------------------+
| Controls   | N21        | N22               |
+------------+------------+-------------------+

For the allelic model, we create a 2x2 contingency table to assign a
p-value using a Fisher's exact test. The first column includes the count
of non-reference genotypes and the second column includes the count of
reference genotypes.

+------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
|            | Alternate genotypes   | Reference genotypes   |
+============+=======================+=======================+
| Cases      | N11                   | N12                   |
+------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| Controls   | N21                   | N22                   |
+------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
